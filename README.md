# EECE430-Project

Instructions to run the code:

After downloading the project as a zip file, extract it and store it in a known location. Open a terminal and make sure you are working on a python django environment before changing the directory to where "mysite430" is located (cd necessary path). Once that is complete, you are ready to run the server by entering "python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000" in your terminal. To access the homepage directly, type "localhost:8000" on your browser. If you wish to go through the sign up process, enter "localhost:8000/signup/".
